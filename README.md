# URP Iridescence Example
![](/Images/sample-01.png)

An example of iridescence shader extending the Lit shader in Unity URP.

Single-layered thin-film BRDF by [Laurent Belcour and Pascal Barla's paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01518344/document).

## TODO
- [x] Single-layered thin-film (Soap bubble)
- [ ] Multi-layered thin-film
- [ ] Diffraction grating (CD-ROM)
- [ ] Biological iridescence (Morpho butterfly wing scales)

I'll need to further study the underlying principle of these iridescences and find a way to modeling them that suitable for real-time rendering.

## Requirement
- Unity 2019.3.2f1 or higher
- Universal Rendering Pipeline 7.4.1
